# Portfolio
This is my very first website that I built and deployed.

Project structure (organized):

- css/: stylesheet files (moved from root)
- js/: JavaScript modules grouped by DOM sections (e.g., `js/navbar.js`)
- index.html: main HTML file
- README.md: this file

Notes:
- Open `index.html` in a browser to view the site locally.
- Static assets referenced by the site (e.g., `Background.gif`, `JH.png`) remain in the repository root if present.
